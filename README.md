# Mask
Mask for Covid, deconstructed from 3D model

I print tested this so that you don't have to!

Mask and strap: 
NinjaTek 3DNF01129010 NinjaTek NinjaFlex TPU Filament
0.3 mm nozzle produces best results.
adaptive layers required for best mask results.

Material for other parts are your choice, but I used PLA.

CURA 3.6.20 Lulzbot edition used for slicing. Might be usable on other slicers.
